# SchoolRewardsProject
One of my first Real 'projects' was to create a point reward system for a primary/secondary school. Essentially each pupil and staff member will be able to login and take them to an appropiate screen where pupils can redeem their points for real wards and various staff memebers can edit the appropiate pupils.
